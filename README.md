# Student_Library_Management_System
This is a Library Management System that is built using rest Api's and using MVC structure and other microservices

A student library management backend application is a software system designed to help manage the library resources of an educational institution such as a school, college, or university. The application typically has two components: a backend that manages the data and a frontend that provides an interface for users to interact with the system.

The backend of the application is responsible for managing the library's resources, including books, journals, magazines, and other materials. It includes features for adding new resources to the library, updating existing ones, and deleting them when necessary. It also tracks the availability of resources, the location of physical copies, and other relevant data.

In addition to resource management, the backend also handles user management. It maintains a database of library users and tracks their borrowing history. It also provides functionality for creating new user accounts, updating user information, and deleting accounts as needed.

Overall, a student library management backend application plays an important role in ensuring that library resources are well-organized and easily accessible to students and faculty. By providing a centralized system for managing library materials and user accounts, the application helps to streamline library operations and enhance the overall user experience.
